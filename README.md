# Web-Design-Challenge

With this challenge, I created a dashboard for the latitude visualizations done in a previous exercise. A landing page will be created that houses a comparison of all the
plots and a way to navigate between each visualization.  For each visualization, there will have a page explaining the results its individual result.  And another page
dedicated to the viewing the data used to build them.

# Installation
You will need access to resources and visualization folders.  The index.html page is the landing page used to view the majority of the project and should be easily 
accessed upon opening it.
